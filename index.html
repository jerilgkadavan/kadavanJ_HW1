                <p class="aboutMySelfpara">My name is Jeril G Kadavan. I prefer to be called as Kadavan. I am born and brought up in Kerala, India. I’ve been working as an animator back in India after my graduation. I moved to Canada in pursuit of learning more about media designing as well as a good international experience.  I’ve been in Canada for around five months now and experiencing the winter, snow and the spirit of Canada.</p> 

<p id="aboutMyHobbies">I love almost all kinds of movies; however, I have a special liking towards action and adventure movies. Fast and furious is one of my favourite movies. Like in the case of movies, I like music of all kind of music, rock being my favourite. I enjoy going for live music concerts and other similar events. My taste in music varies a lot depends upon the situation I am going through.</p> 

<p id="myFeaturePlan">I would like to learn more about media designing and start a career in the same field. I love to lead a life full of happiness and joy and help people out. I learn things more through experiences and hence I long for positive and worthy experiences in life.
